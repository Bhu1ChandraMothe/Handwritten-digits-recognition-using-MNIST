# Handwritten-digits-recognition-using-MNIST
This is a Deep Learning model which uses MNIST Dataset to recognise handwritten single digits.

Add the images of the digits that you can create using Paint (single digits only) in the same directory where the model is and make sure you name them in numbers starting from 1 and in a continuous sequence.
